<h1>The Best Movies According To Aswin</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies according to all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Oppenheimer (2023)</h3>
<p>OPPENHEIMER is a monumental achievement from Christopher Nolan. A powerful story told on the grandest scale possible. Cillian Murphy seizes his moment & turns in a mesmerizing portrayal of moral torment. I also need to specifically shout out the strong Oscar-worthy supporting turns from Robert Downey Jr. & Emily Blunt, tremendous cinematography, thunderous sound, intricate editing & magnificent score by Ludwig G. Nolan’s character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must. It truly left me in awe!

    Please go see it at the theatres, it is a MUST. This is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had sitting in a theatre. “Oppenheimer” is one of the best looking films made, PERIOD. 70MM is the way to go for the sheer visual magnitude, that will unfold & glow before your very eyes. I’m very excited to see what the word thinks of “Oppenheimer”  I believe it is the biggest & baddest film of the year so far.  
    
    Knowing BARBENHEIMER is officially over makes me very sad. However, I will definitely be going back to see “OPPENHEIMER” a second time. Especially, before anything else that comes out this year. 
    
    I predicted the Oscar sweep for Everything Everywhere All At Once Last year and I’m here to say it again, this will sweep at the academy next year. I love predicting stuff so I’ll live with the rest. 
    
    Bravo once again Christopher Nolan, you are a MAGNIFICENT filmmaker. This may be my very favourite film of yours yet. 
    
    Now I come, the creator of life. 
    
    5/5</p>

<h3>Interstellar (2014)</h3>
<p>Time & space , these are two very important phenomrnon which kept humanity think for thousand of years  about this vast infinite universe and to find out its unapproachable interstellar destinations like solar system ,  milkyway , planets , blackholes ,etc. Highly talented great film maker Christopher  nolan has shown his  top class directorial skills by this great Sci fi saga " Interstellar"  . Probably its one of the best movie ever made its not only about finding new home for humanity in interstellar destination but its a emotional sci fi drama also a unbreakable relationship between father & daughter which has been portrayed in  memorable manner never before any director been able to do. Theme of movie  is about a space mission where a team of astronauts have been assigned a project to find out a new home for human race in vast infinite interstellar distances which also have been sewed with emotional father daughter relationship . This great sci fi will left you in deepest portion  of your mind where science & emotion collide with each other . From script to screenplay , cinematography  ,original score , editing , visual effects , performances , direction everything is 5/5. Just give heed to extraordinary directorial skills of Nolan the way he shot space travel  sequences which looks so real that you can feel them . Memorable performances by Mathew Mcconnaughy , Jessica chastin , Michael Caine , matt Damon . The moment when Cooper left the earth for space mission and then checks the logs of past years he found that his little daughter  is of his age now , that leave  everyone  in teary eyes , his promise to his daughter that when they will meet again she will be of his age she is  saying that's right time dad to come back . Just feel emotional intensity of this moment which is unparalleled a great piece of art in cinematic history . This movie leave us to a very likely question is there a future for humanity in interstellar infinite universe  , hopefully there is it will be our great human  efforts which will unravel the secrets of ambiguous universe . Astonishingly brilliant original score of Hans zimmer is another highlight of this great sci fi saga without which it couldn't have been a memorable masterpiece . Very few filmmaker have reached  to such perfection in sci fi zoner at which nolan reached through interstellar , I would recommend this great sci fi saga to everyone , just feel the secrets of mysterious time & space which have shaped our lives , it's a great lifetime experience .</p>

<h3>Gravity (2013)</h3>
<p>Honestly, (for me) the film has very different angles to view. The main plot and idea sent forward was "be careful what you wish for" or more nicely "You get what you want".

    E.g: Matt Kowalsky is charismatic, beauty loving character and this film shows that its his last flight. He also wants to beat Russian astronaut's space time by staying in outer space as much as possible, but unfortunatelly (or fortunately) he had to return after this last mission leaving him no chance to beat this record until life has different  plans on these astronauts. At the end, he is left floating space in an amazing view and beating Russian astronaut.
    
    Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) has very complex ending. She tells that she loves "silence" and "loneliness". FIrst time when space junk hits the shuttle, I thought the real ending was that, she got what she wanted but eventually she gets resqued (or her oxygen runs out she just is left to have all the rest in her imagination). She suffers from depression, and most depressed people think they are better stay alone than hurt by someone else, but in reality those people are the ones who needs help, who needs communication, who is despair. She eventually find her strenghs to fight back and overcome depression. It doesn't matter at this point if she got back to Earth or left floating the Space, she now has understood what she always wanted and left with it. She has the best friend "Matt Kowalsky". 
    
    Conclusion is that, we all are humans, we always need interaction between each other. Watch for your loved ones, keep them safe.</p>
