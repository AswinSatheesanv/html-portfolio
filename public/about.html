<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>As a BSc Electronics graduate, I initially began my career as a hardware technician and gained valuable experience in this field over two years. 
  However, after learning programming, I discovered a new passion and decided to switch my career to programming. 
  Now, I have developed strong skills in Python and C programming, as well as knowledge in HTML, CSS, and a foundational understanding of JavaScript.
  I am excited to continue growing in this field and am actively seeking new opportunities to apply and expand my programming knowledge. 
  I am committed to delivering high-quality work and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new technologies.
  If you're interested in connecting or discussing potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me. 
  I am open to new connections and collaborations in the programming field.</p>
